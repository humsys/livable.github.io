<h1 id="user-content-livable-human-systems" class="deep-link"><a href="#livable-human-systems">Livable Human Systems</a></h1>
<p>Those who design our human systems---who design our businesses, our social networks, our cities, our economies---are limited by their worldviews. In particular, they are limited by what they think people are capable of, and what they think people need.</p>
<p>Our mission is to show designers of human systems how to think differently, so as to design a better world. Our strategy is to build prototypes that shift designers&apos; view of a problem. Each prototype proposes a new answer to a question about what humans need.</p>
<p>Here are some of the areas we work to address:</p>
<h2 id="user-content-soft-automation" class="deep-link"><a href="#soft-automation">Soft Automation</a></h2>
<p>Certain problems emerge as more of our social and work lives are mediated by software. For instance, we find software&apos;s expectations for how we should interact overly rigid, overly mediated, and difficult to modify. It also takes away our authority over our own lives. When this automation takes place by messaging and notifications, there are additional problems: we struggle to get an overview of what is happening, we are forced to check our devices constantly to advance small social projects, and covert and inadvertent power dynamics emerge in chatrooms.</p>
<p>These problems stem from a view of automation---and of software more generally---that puts process above people. By redefining software in terms of editable social scripts that make soft suggestions, we can avoid them. With soft automation the software is never in charge. The user is always free to submit some other data, to send it to some other person, or even to rewrite the script to change roles and rules completely.</p>
<h2 id="user-content-dignified-metrics" class="deep-link"><a href="#dignified-metrics">Dignified Metrics</a></h2>
<p>Companies and apps which interact with us are scored and recommended by algorithms and ranking systems and analytics APIs. When an app or media object &quot;goes viral&quot;---or is considered a success---that judgement is based on how much it get us entertained or engaged. This is undignified---people are viewed as objects to be manipulated, rather than as agents with their own values, goals, and reasons. If, instead, apps are scored by how well they support the expression of our values, we can build better systems for listing and recommendation and business success.</p>
<h2 id="user-content-user-interfaces-as-choicemaking-environments" class="deep-link"><a href="#user-interfaces-as-choicemaking-environments">User Interfaces as Choicemaking Environments</a></h2>
<p>When devices present menus to us, the presentation can encourage us to make thoughtful and decisive choices, or it can encourage us to scroll along thoughtlessly. UIs that give us meaningful choices are not the same as UIs that put us in funnels.</p>
<h2 id="user-content-social-networks-as-spaces-for-growth" class="deep-link"><a href="#social-networks-as-spaces-for-growth">Social Networks as Spaces for Growth</a></h2>
<p>One function of our social relations is to give us space to be ourselves, or to grow into who we want to be; To protect us--to give us refuge while we explore something of value. We could be exploring a kind of creativity, a kind of vulnerability, a sensory awareness, or a field of interest, etc.</p>
<p>Our social platforms and social media systems haven&apos;t been designed with this in mind. They often leave us unsupported, occupied with busywork, sensorily isolated, and exposed. Neither newsfeeds nor comment threads--our most popular structured asynchronous media--seem to have the right characteristics. Unstructured and synchronous forms--like text and video chat--have other problems. Broadcast media--including books and films--are better in some ways, but are also isolating.</p>
<hr>
<p>We are open to adding researchers and funding. Get in touch if you want to help.</p>
<p>We will mostly hire researchers that have already made prototypes that fit our criteria and who want support and a community in which to take them further.</p>
<p>Researchers can join <a href="mailto:livable-media@groups.google.com">livable-media@groups.google.com</a> and send an intro email explaining how your current or past research and projects relate to our problem areas.</p>
