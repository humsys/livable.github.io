# Livable Human Systems

Those who design our human systems---who design our businesses, our social networks, our cities, our economies---are limited by their worldviews. In particular, they are limited by what they think people are capable of, and what they think people need.

Our mission is to show designers of human systems how to think differently, so as to design a better world. Our strategy is to build prototypes that shift designers' view of a problem. Each prototype proposes a new answer to a question about what humans need.

Here are some areas where we have such prototypes:


Soft Automation
---------------

Our social and work lives are ever-more mediated by software, and this creates problems: Software's expectations for how we should interact are overly *rigid*, overly *mediated*, and *difficult to modify*. Automation also takes away our authority over our own lives. When automation happens via messaging and notifications, yet more problems emerge: we struggle to get an overview of what is happening, we're forced to check our devices constantly to advance even small projects, and covert power dynamics form between mediated people.

These problems stem from an approach to automation---and to software more generally---that puts process above people. **Soft automation** redefines software in terms of editable social scripts which make only soft suggestions. The software is never in charge. The user is always free to submit some other data, to send it to some other person, or to rewrite the script and change roles and rules completely.


Dignified Metrics
-----------------

Simple quantitative metrics determine much of our lives--what's successful in business, what's successful in media, and which apps, videos, articles, search suggestions, etc, we are shown as we navigate through our days.

But currently those metrics are all about the business/app/video's ability to manipulate us--how much it get us entertained or engaged. This is undignified---people are viewed as objects with behavior, rather than as agents with their own values, goals, and reasons.

Instead, apps [can be scored by how well they support the daily expression of our values](http://nxhx.org/maximizing/). This can move us away from an exploitative attention economy and towards an economy which helps us to live the lives we want.


User Interfaces as Choicemaking Environments
--------------------------------------------

Much of our daily lives are structured by menus. Whether we are deciding which email to respond to, what to order at a restaurant, which stores to visit on a street or in a mall, what job listings to investigateâ€”we navigate our lives by scanning lists of options.

We can ask, then, what are the responsibilities of menu-makers?

When devices present menus to us, that presentation can encourage us to make thoughtful and decisive choices, or it can encourage us to scroll along thoughtlessly.

How can we design screens and other interfaces so as to let the user pursue what they really want in the moment, rather than piping them through some funnel we've designed for them?



Social Networks as Spaces for Growth
------------------------------------

One function of our social relations is to give us space to be ourselves, or to grow into who we want to be; To protect us--to give us refuge while we explore something of value. We could be exploring a kind of creativity, a kind of vulnerability, a sensory awareness, or a field of interest, etc.

Our social platforms and social media systems haven't been designed with this in mind. They often leave us unsupported, occupied with busywork, sensorily isolated, and exposed. Neither newsfeeds nor comment threads--our most popular structured asynchronous media--seem to have the right characteristics. Unstructured and synchronous forms--like text and video chat--have other problems. Broadcast media--including books and films--are better in some ways, but are also isolating.

We are open to adding researchers and funding. Get in touch if you want to help.

We will mostly hire researchers that have already made prototypes that fit our criteria and who want support and a community in which to take them further.

Researchers can join <livable-media@groups.google.com> and send an intro email explaining how your current or past research and projects relate to our problem areas.
