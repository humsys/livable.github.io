# A Call, to Come Work on Livable Technology and Livable Media

There is important work on the future of media that's not getting done. Neither the bright-eyed app makers nor academic tech critics are facing down the big problems with the current media and tech environment and lighting the way forward.

We need the tech equivalent of the utopian urban planners and the livable cities movement. They looked at problems like sprawl and pollution and neighborhood decline, and articulated how to aim for better cities.  

We are starting the Center for Livable Media to figure out how to fix what's wrong with the current technological and media landscape, and then to demonstrate what a better landscape might look like, so as to inform industry, policy, and open source projects.

To this end, our researchers will make three different types of prototypes: First, we'll build exploratory prototypes that might point to solutions for one of the problems we've identified.  Next, we'll build proofs of concept—tests of an alternative technological regime in which it is possible to live for a while—to see whether they really feel better for people. Finally, we'll build persuasive prototypes that aim to influence industry in a particular direction.


We are focusing on four problem areas:


1. Executable Dreams

When toolmakers talk about the future of programming, they often focus on making it easier to make simple games, or to do business analytics, or to manipulate mathematical models. We believe there's a more important domain in which to make programming easier (or unnecessary): the domain of our individual and social dreams.

While some of us may dream of making a particular app or a particular game, there are more common dreams: a regular dinner party, a book club, advisors and collaborators for a project idea, a party which requires complex coordination, a running buddy each week.

Existing platforms like Meetup and Facebook Groups go some distance in helping us to realize these dreams, but they have no provision for automatic scheduling, for dependencies, for tasks and roles, and for workflows more generally. And while they promise us a social dream, in the meantime we are isolated organizers behind screens, administering the bureaucracy of messaging that we hope will lead to a successful potluck or camping trip or whatever.

Most often, instead of dreaming up the social relations that would support us best, we choose social relations that fit into an app or the prevailing culture. Swiping left or right on faces late into the night, commenting on ridiculous political articles, without ever imagining a way of relating that would suit us better.

Let's dream again.



2. Networks of Refuge

One function of our social relations is to give us space to be ourselves, or to grow into who we want to be; To protect us--to give us refuge while we explore something of value. That could be a kind of creativity (as in relationships of creative riffing), a kind of vulnerability (as in intimate relationships), or a field of interest (as in a mentorship).

New social platforms and social media systems have not been designed with this in mind. While they create some kinds of refuge, in other areas they leave us unsupported and/or exposed. Newsfeeds and comment threads--our most popular structured asynchronous media--don't seem to have the right characteristics; while the unstructured and synchronous forms, like text and video chat, have other problems. Broadcast media like books and films provide certain kinds of refuge but are unsupportive in other ways.

We believe it will be possible to find structured formats that make room for the full social fabric.



3. Dignified Protocols

Our devices can act so as to weaken or to strengthen our individuality and agency. This happens on many levels:

* the menus presented can either encourage us to make thoughtful and decisive choices, or can encourage us to scroll along thoughtlessly

* companies and apps which interact with us can be scored based on how much they get us entertained or addicted, versus how well the support the full expression of our values

The protocols that govern the interaction of the device with the user, the user with apps and companies Etc.... These can be dignified or undignified. We say they are dignified when they meet the user as an agent, undignified when they manipulate the user by driving behavior that doesn't come from the users own agency.







## Working with Us

We will mostly hire researchers that have already made prototypes that fit our criteria and who want support and a community in which to take them further.

We are open to adding other problem areas, if they can be articulated clearly and have direct relevance to human life, individual agency, and the social fabric[1].


[1] There is a tendency in technology to focus on technical ideals rather than human ideals. Technical ideals include decentralization, open source and open standards, inspectability, cryptographic security and privacy, and so on. In our experience, it is worth keeping one's eye on the human ideals, rather than pointing an organizational mission towards technical ideals which are, at best, proxies for what we really need.
